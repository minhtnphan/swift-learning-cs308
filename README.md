# swift-learning-cs308
This is the repository for my project in Programming Languages course, Spring 2022 at Fulbright University Vietnam.<br>
<br>
The repo contains my notes on Swift programming language, and a project to apply my learnings of the language to real-life application.<br>
For PLPs/Swift notes, please see [About Swift](https://github.com/minhtnphan/swift-learning-cs308/blob/main/AboutSwift.md) markdown and [helloworld](https://github.com/minhtnphan/swift-learning-cs308/tree/main/helloworld) folder.

# Flappy Dove
Flappy Dove is a replication of the popular game - Flappy Bird. Flappy Dove is written in Swift using SpriteKit framework to construct game scenes and objects. Interestingly, I found SpriteKit as a perfect example of Object Oriented Programming's characteristics, specifically encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance and abstraction.<br>
<br>
Flappy Dove's game rule is simple: you try to fly the dove as far as possible while avoiding the bread obstacles on the way. Each pair of breads the bird passes, you earn one point.
Look at Flappy Dove's code [here](https://github.com/minhtnphan/swift-learning-cs308/tree/main/FlappyDove). And below is the demo of the game:<br>
